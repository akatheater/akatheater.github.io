#### Somagic

This is an individual project. 

**Summary**

·    A narrative-driven game in which the player plays the role of an administrator of an institute, dispenses medicines for patients in the institute, records their status, and decides their fate.

·    Multi-role, multi-story line for players to explore freely.

·    Piece together the truth of the incident through exploration.

·    Make meaningful choices, change the fate of the character, and influence the direction of the story.

**What I learned in game design**

·    I learned more about the narrative methods of game, including level narrative and scene narrative. I tried to give up a lot of cutscenes and text description. I set up specific reactions to specific situations for the characters in the game, hoping that players can trigger these reactions through their own choices, so as to create their own plots.

·    I tried the game design method of experience first and story later. I wrote a lot of stories, and discarded the ones that did not resonate with the players, and kept the ones that could bring players a specific emotional experience.

**What I learned in other areas**

·    I studied the game developing tools like Unity, Cinema 4D.

·    I have developed the habit of recording and organizing the development process, and effectively managing each version.

**In this project, I cited following external resource to assit in development:**

·    Save system using Advanced-Save-System Plug-in

·    Transformation of Json using excel2json

·    Use animation from [www.mixamo.com](http://www.mixamo.com)

·    Use audio from maoudamashii.jokersounds.com

#### Chronus

This is a team project. There’s a total of 2 group members.

My main tasks are to design the game. I designed the gameplay, completed the mechanism design and puzzle design, built the level, and adjusted the difficulty according to the feedback of the players. I also completed the setting of the background of the game story, and designed the narrative method and specific plot.

**Summary**

·    A puzzle-solving game that uses changing the speed of time as the main puzzle-solving method. 

·    The puzzle solving process can be seen as a coherent story, which tells how Alice escaped from the Red Heart Castle with the help of time and friends.

**What I learned from the project**

·    I learned the theory of level design and tried to build my own level. At first, I would only stack multiple mechanisms. Later, I tried to conduct in-depth research on a single mechanism, trying to make a mechanism have multiple functions.

·    I learned how to control the difficulty of the game. I split all possible mechanisms into the smallest elements and filled them in the table. When I was designing the level, I filled in the proportion of the element where it appeared, and then converted it into a value representing the difficulty. In this way, I controlled the difficulty of the level.

**What I learned from teamwork**

·    I learned how to communicate my intentions efficiently, using prototypes, diagrams and other means to help explain.

·    I learned to allocate a reasonable amount of time for a certain amount of work, and make appropriate compromises to turn unrealistic ideas into achievable goals.

**In this project, I cited following external resource to assit in development:**

·    Use audio from maoudamashii.jokersounds.com, www.aigei.com
